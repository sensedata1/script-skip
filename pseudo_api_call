if "description" contains P1 and "priority" = Critical and "some_field" does not contain CLOSED and "EVENT_ID" is not in $DATA_FILE
then
	jq | . > "$NEW_ALERT_FILE"

	DATA_FILE=alert_log.txt
	NEW_ALERT_FILE=new_alert.txt
	TEMP_FILE=tempfile.txt

if $DATA_FILE changes then play wav

cat $NEW_ALERT $DATA_FILE > $TEMP_FILE; mv $TEMP_FILE $DATA_FILE

API queries meeting the jq filter should only be returned if they are critical P1 alerts and not CLOSED notifications. 

They are then appended to the data.json output file
so new alerts are prepended***

cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt; mv file3.txt file2.txt
